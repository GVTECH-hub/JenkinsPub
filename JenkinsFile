 * This script performs the following operations:
 * 1. Initializes a list of integers.
 * 2. Iterates through the list and prints each integer.
 * 3. Checks if each integer is even or odd and prints the result.
 * 4. Sums all the integers in the list and prints the total sum.
 * 
 * The script demonstrates basic list operations, iteration, conditional checks, and summation in Groovy.
